      <description>As stated in my previous blog post, I created a march madness bracket without knowing a whole bunch about basketball.
Now that the tournament is officially over, I can compare my predictions against the actual outcomes. The results were unfortunate, my model having a lot of faith in the Big 10–which I should have realized was a mistake from the start.
I ended up placing near the bottom of my class’s group of brackets, more specifically 12th out of 17.</description>

      <description>I want to preface this with saying that this is the first time I have ever filled out a March Madness bracket. The extent of my college basketball knowledge before my Sports Data class was (1) my dad’s undying support for all of USC’s sports teams and (2) the tragedy that is Nebraska basketball–and neither got me very far.
So, when I was prompted to create a bracket using machine learning I had nothing to lose and everything to gain.</description>
